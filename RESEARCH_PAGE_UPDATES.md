# Research Page Updates - Matching Tural Karimli's Layout

## Summary of Changes

Your research page has been updated to better match [Tural Karimli's research page](https://turalkarimli.github.io/research/) with improved dynamic content handling.

## Key Improvements

### 1. ‚úÖ Dynamic Content Display

The page now intelligently hides empty sections:

- **Empty Abstracts** - Abstract toggle only appears if abstract text exists
- **Empty Conferences** - "Selected Conferences:" section hidden when `conferences={}`
- **Empty Awards** - Award badge only shows when present
- **Optional Links** - PDF/Slides/Code buttons only appear when set
- **Optional Audio** - Audio player hidden when not provided

**How it works:** The layout now checks if fields are not just present, but also not empty strings, using Liquid's `strip` filter and conditional checks.

### 2. üé® Improved Layout & Styling

**Typography:**
- Refined font sizes to match Tural's cleaner look
- Better line height (1.65 for abstracts, 1.5 for titles)
- Lighter font weights for a more modern appearance

**Spacing:**
- Reduced image width from 200px to 180px for better proportions
- Adjusted margins and padding throughout
- Better vertical rhythm between elements

**Visual Design:**
- Softer shadows on images (from `0 2px 8px` to `0 1px 4px`)
- Sharper border radius (4px ‚Üí 3px)
- Improved conference tag styling with monospace font
- Subtle hover effects on author links (dotted underline transition)
- Micro-interaction on buttons (slight lift on hover)

**Separators:**
- Changed to `:not(:last-child)` for cleaner separator logic
- Maintains horizontal lines between papers

### 3. üì± Better Responsive Design

Enhanced mobile experience:
- Smaller image max-width on mobile (250px vs 300px)
- Adjusted font sizes for readability
- Better padding in abstract boxes
- Maintains clean layout on all screen sizes

### 4. üîß Code Quality

**Template Improvements:**
- Added clear comments explaining conditional logic
- More robust empty string checking
- Cleaner conference list parsing
- Better handling of edge cases

## Files Modified

1. **`_layouts/bib-research.liquid`**
   - Added dynamic content checks for abstracts, conferences, awards
   - Improved conditional rendering logic
   - Better comments for maintainability

2. **`_pages/publications.md`**
   - Completely refined CSS to match Tural's design
   - Better typography and spacing
   - Improved responsive breakpoints
   - Smoother transitions and hover effects

3. **`RESEARCH_PAGE_GUIDE.md`**
   - Added "Dynamic Content Features" section
   - Updated tips with more details
   - Better documentation of empty field behavior

## Usage Example

In your `papers.bib`:

```bibtex
@unpublished{ruffo2024factor,
  title={Factor Dispersions},
  author={Ruffo, Vittorio Maria and Gerchik, D. and Vilkov, Grigory},
  year={2024},
  abstract={Your full abstract here...},
  paper_number={1},
  preview={paper1.png},
  conferences={EFA 2025; AFA 2024},  % Shows conference tags
  award_name={CBOE Research Grant}
}

@unpublished{ruffo2024market,
  title={Market Efficiency in Prediction Markets},
  author={Ruffo, Vittorio Maria and Fabi, M. and Marf√®, R.},
  year={2024},
  abstract={},          % Empty - no abstract section shown
  paper_number={2},
  preview={paper2.png},
  conferences={}        % Empty - no conference section shown
}
```

## What Happens Now

**Paper 1 displays:**
- Image
- Title with [1] number
- Coauthors
- ‚úÖ Abstract (with toggle)
- ‚úÖ Award badge
- ‚úÖ Conference tags

**Paper 2 displays:**
- Image
- Title with [2] number
- Coauthors
- ‚ùå No abstract section (hidden)
- ‚ùå No award (not set)
- ‚ùå No conferences (hidden)

The page stays clean and professional, showing only relevant information!

## Testing

1. **With Conferences:**
   ```bibtex
   conferences={EFA 2025; AFA 2024}
   ```
   Result: Shows "Selected Conferences:" with tags

2. **Without Conferences:**
   ```bibtex
   conferences={}
   ```
   Result: Entire conference section hidden

3. **Empty Abstract:**
   ```bibtex
   abstract={}
   ```
   Result: No "Abstract ‚ñº" toggle shown

## Next Steps

1. Fill in your abstracts in `_bibliography/papers.bib`
2. Add conferences as they happen
3. Replace placeholder images with actual paper figures
4. The page will automatically update to show/hide sections as needed

## Preview

Visit `http://localhost:4000/research/` after running `bundle exec jekyll serve`

Your research page now perfectly matches Tural Karimli's clean, professional layout while remaining fully dynamic and bibliography-driven! üéâ
