  abstract={Dispersion strategies capture the difference in variance dynamics between a basket and its components. Even though smart-beta indices intend to load heavily on a particular factor, factor dispersions based on such baskets are exposed to risks of other factors and idiosyncratic variances. Analyzing factor dispersions through a linear factor model and equicorrelation representations, we recover driving forces behind dispersion dynamics and work out an attribution of a dispersion risk premium. As a balanced combination of systematic and idiosyncratic variance components, dispersion and its risk premium provide signals about future changes in systematic and alpha-based investment opportunities.},
