Welcome to my webpage! I am a PhD candidate in Finance at the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management.

My research focuses on news and textual data, firm networks, volatility, and asset pricing. I am interested in how information flows through economic, technological, and geopolitical channels.

I hold an MSc in Finance from the Collegio Carlo Alberto, as well as an MSc in Quantitative Finance and a BSc in Economics and Business from the University of Verona.

You can contact me at **[v.ruffo@fs.de](mailto:v.ruffo@fs.de)** or connect with me on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vittoriomariaruffo/)**.
