Welcome! I am a PhD student in Finance at Frankfurt School of Finance & Management, working under the supervision of Prof. Grigory Vilkov.

My research interests include **asset pricing**, **volatility**, and **machine learning** applications in finance. I am particularly interested in understanding the dynamics of financial markets through the lens of derivatives and options markets.

## Research

My current research focuses on factor dispersions and market efficiency. My working paper on **Factor Dispersions** (with D. Gerchik, L. Schoenleber, and G. Vilkov) was awarded the CBOE-The Options Institute-S&P Dow Jones Indices Dispersion Research Grant in 2024.

I am also working on several other projects, including market efficiency in prediction markets and firm-level news networks.

## Education

I hold a Master's degree in Banking and Finance (Quantitative Finance Track) from the University of Verona, where I graduated with honours (110/110 with honours). Prior to joining Frankfurt School, I completed a specialized Master in Finance, Insurance and Risk Management at Collegio Carlo Alberto and University of Turin with a merit-based full tuition waiver.

## Teaching

I am passionate about teaching and have been involved in various teaching activities at Frankfurt School, including lecturing on Corporate Finance and Python programming, as well as serving as a teaching assistant for courses in Financial Products & Modelling and Portfolio Management.
