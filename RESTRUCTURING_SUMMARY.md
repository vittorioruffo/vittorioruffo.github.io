Following best practices from `CUSTOMIZE.md`, the following demo content was excluded in `_config.yml` rather than deleted:
- `_posts/` (all blog posts)
- `_news/` (all news items)
- `_projects/` (all project demos)

This approach avoids merge conflicts when updating the theme in the future.

- Disabled related blog posts
- Disabled masonry layout (not needed without projects)
- Disabled project categories
- Removed demo GitHub repositories from `_data/repositories.yml`
- Removed `assets/json/resume.json` to ensure `cv.yml` is used

## Profile Picture

The website references `prof_pic.jpg` in the `assets/img/` directory. A default image exists, but you should replace it with your own professional photo.

## Next Steps

1. **Replace Profile Picture**: Add your photo as `assets/img/prof_pic.jpg`
2. **Verify Information**: Review all content to ensure accuracy
3. **Add More Details**: Consider adding more information to the about page
4. **Update Research**: Keep the bibliography updated as research progresses
5. **Deploy**: Follow the deployment instructions in `INSTALL.md`

## File Structure

Key files modified:
```
